text = "   this   text   has   extra   spaces   "
text = " ".join(text.split())
print(text)

# Let me explain this part of the code: text = " ".join(text.split()).
# text.split() splits the text string into a list of words, using the whitespace characters as a separator. For example, " this text has extra spaces ".split() will return ['this', 'text', 'has', 'extra', 'spaces'].
# " ".join(text.split()) then joins the elements in the list with a single space character, effectively collapsing any extra spaces between words. The result of this expression is a string of words separated by a single space.
# So, the line text = " ".join(text.split()) is equivalent to saying: "Replace the text string with a new string that is constructed by joining the words in text with a single space character."
